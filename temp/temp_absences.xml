TEMP
-------------
TEMP is a software package for detecting transposable elements (TEs)  insertions and absences from pooled high-throughput sequencing data

Current version v1.04

Author: Jiali Zhuang (jiali.zhuang@umassmed.edu) and Jie Wang (jie.wangj@umassmed.edu) Weng Lab, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA

*Input files/variables*
-------------------------
* Alignment file in BAM format
* Reference genome used in aligning, in fasta or twobit format.
* Transposable Elements' Consensus Sequences in fasta format.
* Annotations of TEs in reference genome in bed format.
* TE Identifiers and Families (optional) - A file containing in the first column the TE names/identifiers from the consensus sequences file, and in the second column, their respective TE family names as in the TE annotations file. When supplied, if a detected insertion overlaps with an annotated TE of the same family, the detected insertion will be excluded from the results.
* Median Insert Length
* Number of Mismatches allowed (default 3)
* Minimum difference between mapping scores. The minimum difference in scores between the optimal and suboptimal alignments to consider a read uniquely mapped.

*Output files*
-----------------
* **In the Insertions output file there are 14 columns:**
* Column 1: The chromosome where the detected insertion happens.
* Column 2: The coordinate of the start position of the detected insertion.
* Column 3: The coordinate of the end position of the detected insertion.
* Column 4: The TE family that the detected insertion belongs to.
* Column 5: The direction of the insertion. “Plus” means that the TE is integrated with the plus strand of the genome while “minus” means the TE is integrated with the minus strand.
* Column 6: The class of the insertion. “1p1” means that the detected insertion is supported by reads at both sides. “2p” means the detected insertion is supported by more than 1 read at only 1 side. “Singleton” means the detected insertion is supported by only 1 read at 1 side.
* Column 7: The total number of read pairs that support the detected insertion.
* Column 8: The estimated population frequency of the detected insertion.
* Columns 9 & 10: The coordinate of a junction and the number of the reads supporting it. If the junction is not found column 9 will be the arithmetic mean of the start and end coordinates and column 10 will have the value 0.
* Columns 11 & 12: Same as Columns 9 & 10 except for the junction on the other strand.
* Column 13: The number of reads supporting the detected insertion at the 5’ end of the TE (not including junction spanning reads).
* Column 13: The number of reads supporting the detected insertion at the 3’ end of the TE (not including junction spanning reads).


-----


* **In the Absences output file there are 14 columns:**
* Column 1: The chromosome where the detected absence happens.
* Column 2: The coordinate of the start position of the detected absence.
* Column 3: The coordinate of the end position of the detected absence.
* Column 4: The TE family that the detected insertion belongs to.
* Column 5: Junctions at 5’ of the excised TE. The two numbers are the coordinates of the junctions on the two strands.
* Column 6: Junctions at 3’ of the excised TE. The two numbers are the coordinates of the junctions on the two strands.
* Column 7: The number of reads supporting the absence.
* Column 8: The number of reads supporting the reference (no absence).
* Column 9: Estimated population frequency of the detected absence event.
